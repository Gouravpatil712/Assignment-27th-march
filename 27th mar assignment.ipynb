    "R-squared (R²) is a statistical measure that represents the proportion of the variance in the dependent variable that is explained by the independent variables in a linear regression model. In other words, R² measures how well the model fits the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared is calculated as the ratio of the explained variance to the total variance of the dependent variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "R² = Explained variance / Total variance\n",
    "\n",
    "where the explained variance is the sum of squared differences between the predicted values and the mean of the dependent variable, and the total variance is the sum of squared differences between the actual values and the mean of the dependent variable.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared ranges from 0 to 1, where a value of 0 indicates that the model explains none of the variance in the dependent variable, and a value of 1 indicates that the model explains all of the variance in the dependent variable. A higher R² indicates a better fit of the model to the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "R-squared has some limitations as a measure of model performance, particularly when dealing with complex models or with data that has a high degree of variability. It is important to also consider other measures of model performance, such as adjusted R-squared, root mean squared error (RMSE), and mean absolute error (MAE), among others."

    "Adjusted R-squared is a modified version of the regular R-squared that takes into account the number of predictors in a linear regression model. It is calculated as:\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusted R² = 1 - [(1 - R²) * (n - 1) / (n - k - 1)]\n",
    "\n",
    "where n is the sample size and k is the number of predictors in the model.\n",
    "\n",
    "The difference between adjusted R-squared and the regular R-squared is that adjusted R-squared penalizes the addition of more predictors to the model that do not significantly improve the fit. This is important because the regular R-squared will always increase with the addition of more predictors, even if they do not actually improve the fit of the model. This can lead to overfitting the model to the training data and poor performance on new, unseen data.\n",
    "\n",
    "Adjusted R-squared, on the other hand, accounts for the number of predictors in the model and adjusts the R-squared value downwards if the additional predictors do not significantly improve the fit. This means that it provides a more conservative estimate of the goodness of fit of the model and helps to prevent overfitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, adjusted R-squared is a more reliable measure of the performance of a linear regression model than the regular R-squared, especially when dealing with large numbers of predictors. However, it should be used in combination with other measures of model performance, such as root mean squared error (RMSE) and mean absolute error (MAE), to assess the overall quality of the model."

    "RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error), MSE (Mean Squared Error), and MAE (Mean Absolute Error) are commonly used metrics in the context of regression analysis to evaluate the accuracy of a regression model's predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "MSE is the average of the squared differences between the predicted and actual values of the target variable. It is calculated by taking the sum of the squared errors and dividing it by the number of observations:\n",
    "\n",
    "MSE = 1/n * ∑(y - y_hat)^2\n",
    "\n",
    "where n is the number of observations, y is the actual value of the target variable, and y_hat is the predicted value of the target variable.\n",

    "\n",
    "RMSE = sqrt(MSE)\n",

    "MAE is the average of the absolute differences between the predicted and actual values of the target variable. It is calculated by taking the sum of the absolute errors and dividing it by the number of observations:\n",

    "MSE, RMSE, and MAE all represent the error between the predicted and actual values of the target variable. A lower value of any of these metrics indicates a better fit between the predicted and actual values. MSE and RMSE penalize larger errors more heavily than MAE because they square the difference between the predicted and actual values, whereas MAE only takes the absolute value of the difference. RMSE is generally preferred over MSE because it is on the same scale as the target variable and is more easily interpretable. MAE is useful when the presence of outliers is expected or when the focus is on the magnitude of the errors rather than their direction."

    "Lasso regularization, also known as L1 regularization, is a technique used in linear regression to prevent overfitting and improve the model's generalization performance. Like Ridge regularization, Lasso regularization adds a penalty term to the regression equation. However, instead of adding the sum of squared coefficients (L2 penalty) as in Ridge regression, Lasso adds the sum of the absolute values of the coefficients (L1 penalty).\n",

This is because Lasso's ability to eliminate irrelevant features makes it easier to interpret the model and reduces the risk of overfitting. However, if all the features in the dataset are potentially relevant and should be included in the model, then Ridge regularization may be more appropriate."

    "Regularized linear models add a penalty term to the cost function of the model, which reduces the magnitude of the coefficients and thus helps to prevent overfitting.

    "For example, let's say we have a dataset of housing prices with various features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, and location. We want to build a linear regression model to predict the price of a house based on these features. Without regularization, the model may try to fit the noise in the data, leading to overfitting. This can result in a model that performs well on the training data but poorly on new, unseen data.\n",

    "1. Interpretability: The addition of a penalty term to the cost function of regularized linear models can make the resulting models more complex and difficult to interpret. This can make it harder to understand the relationship between the input features and the target variable.\n",
